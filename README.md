# Simple Tic-Tac-Toe (Kotlin)

## Introduction

This repository contains my implementation of the classic game Tic-Tac-Toe, written in Kotlin. The game, also known as
Noughts and Crosses or Xs and Os, is a timeless paper-and-pencil game that many of us played during our childhood. In
this project, I've created a digital version that you can play in your terminal.

Tic-Tac-Toe is a game where a single mistake can cost you the match, but it's simple enough for players to quickly learn
the optimal strategies.

## Features

- Play against a computer opponent
- Text-based interface
- Simple and intuitive gameplay

2. Navigate to the directory containing the project files.

4. Run the compiled application to start the game.
