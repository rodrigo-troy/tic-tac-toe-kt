# Simple Tic-Tac-Toe (Kotlin)

## Introduction

This repository contains my implementation of the classic game Tic-Tac-Toe, written in Kotlin. The game, also known as
Noughts and Crosses or Xs and Os, is a timeless paper-and-pencil game that many of us played during our childhood. In
this project, I've created a digital version that you can play in your terminal.

Tic-Tac-Toe is a game where a single mistake can cost you the match, but it's simple enough for players to quickly learn
the optimal strategies.

## Features

- Text-based interface
- Simple and intuitive gameplay

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the project files.
3. Compile the Kotlin code using your preferred method.
4. Run the compiled application to start the game.
5. Follow the on-screen prompts to make your moves.
